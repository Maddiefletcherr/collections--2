    <h1>Coffee</h1>
    <P>   I found this coffee in the kitchen while on my stroll through the house. I love coffee maybe a little too much. Coffee is something That Ill never be able to live without. It is a life long addiction. It is always there when I need it. By far te best drink known to mankind.</P>

       <P>I prefer to drink my coffee black. I find that it tastes better straight from the pot without cream and sugar. This dark, hot drink will forver be the best drink on the planet.</P>
