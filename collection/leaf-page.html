    <h1>Leaves</h1>
    
    <p>Leaves are a beautiful part of nature and the great outdoors. I found these leaves while on a stroll outside. They are my absolute favourite part of the outdoors. They are so delicate and interesting.
    </p>


    <p>They never stay the same colour. They are delicate, yet they have the ability to fly kilometeres awy without putting a single tear in it. They come in so many bright and fun coloiurs. M favourite part about leaves is when they slowly start to change colours on the tree. They look so gorgeous and it brings so much light to the world.</p>
